🌍 World Database – SQL Practice
This repository contains my SQL practice work using the MySQL World (City–Country) sample database.
I used this dataset to practice writing queries on real-world country, city, and population data and to improve my understanding of how relational databases work.

What I practiced

Filtering data using WHERE,
Aggregations with GROUP BY,
Working with multiple tables using JOIN,
Subqueries and CTEs,
Basic analytical queries

Tools

MySQL Workbench
SQL

This project is part of my journey to strengthen my SQL and data analysis fundamentals.
